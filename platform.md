# Platform Interface Specification

This document specifies the interface between a lifecycle and a platform.

A platform orchestrates a lifecycle to make buildpack functionality available to end-users such as application developers.

Examples of a platform might include:

1. A local CLI tool that uses buildpacks to create OCI images
2. A plugin for a continuous integration service that uses buildpacks to create OCI images
3. A cloud application platform that uses buildpacks to build source code before deployment

## Stacks

A **stack** is defined by a base run OCI image and a base build OCI image that are only updated with security patches. Stack images can be modified with mixins. For a given stack, a single stack ID designates the base run image, base build image, and all images derived from these images using mixins.

A **mixin** is a named set of changes that may be applied to a stack.

A **launch layer** refers to a layer created from a  `<launch>/<layer>` directory as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

An **app layer** refers to a layer created from the `<app>` directory as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

### Compatibility Guarantees

Stack authors SHOULD ensure that build image versions maintain [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with previous versions, although violating this requirement will not change the behavior of previously built images containing app and launch layers.

Stack authors MUST ensure that new run image versions maintain [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with previous versions.
Stack authors MUST ensure that app and launch layers do not change behavior when the run image layers are upgraded to newer versions, unless those behavior changes are intended to fix security vulnerabilities.

Mixin authors MUST ensure that applying a mixin is an additive, idempotent operation that does not affect the [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) of any object code compiled to run on the base stack images.

To build an OCI image, platforms MUST use the same set of mixins for the run image as were used in the base image.

### Build Image

The platform MUST execute the detection and build phases of the lifecycle on the build image.

The build image MUST ensure that:

- The image config's `User` field is set to a non-root user with a writable home directory.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `PACK_STACK_ID` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.id` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.mixins` set to a JSON array containing mixin names for each mixin applied to the image.

To initiate the detection phase, the platform MUST invoke the `/lifecycle/detector` executable with the user and environment defined in the build image config.
Invoking this executable with no flags is equivalent to the following invocation including all accepted flags and their default values.

```bash
/lifecycle/detector -buildpacks /buildpacks -order /buildpacks/order.toml -group ./group.toml -plan ./plan.toml
```

Where:

- `-buildpacks` MUST specify input from a buildpacks directory as defined in the [Buildpacks Directory Layout](#buildpacks-directory-layout) section.
- `-order` MUST specify input from an overriding `order.toml` file path as defined in the [Data Format](#data-format) section.
- `-group` MUST specify output to a `group.toml` file path as defined in the [Data Format](#data-format) section.
- `-plan` MUST specify output to a Build Plan as defined in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](#buildpacks-directory-layout).

To initiate the build phase, the platform MUST invoke the `/lifecycle/builder` executable with the user and environment defined in the build image config.
Invoking this executable with no flags is equivalent to the following invocation including all accepted flags and their default values.

```bash
/lifecycle/builder -buildpacks /buildpacks -group ./group.toml -plan ./plan.toml
```

Where:

- `-buildpacks` MUST specify input from a buildpacks directory as defined in the [Buildpacks Directory Layout](#buildpacks-directory-layout) section.
- `-group` MUST specify input from a `group.toml` file path as defined in the [Data Format](#data-format) section.
- `-plan` MUST specify input from a Build Plan as defined in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

### Run Image

The platform MUST provide the lifecycle with a reference to the run image during the export phase.

The run image MUST ensure that:

- The image config's `User` field is set to a user with the same UID and primary GID as in the build image.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.id` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.mixins` set to a JSON array containing mixin names for each mixin applied to the image.

### Mixins

A mixin name MUST be unique to a given stack. A mixin MUST be stored in a directory with an identical name to the mixin. The directory MUST contain either of both of the following Dockerfiles that take a single `stack` build argument and begin with `FROM $stack`:

- `build.Dockerfile`, which contains changes for the stack build image, and
- `run.Dockerfile`, which contains changes for the stack run image.

A platform MAY support mixins in order to support application code or buildpacks that require modifications to a particular stack.

## Buildpacks

### Buildpacks Directory Layout

The buildpacks directory MUST contain unpackaged buildpacks such that:

- Each top-level directory is a buildpack ID.
- Each second-level directory is a buildpack version and contains the corresponding unpackaged buildpack.
- Each top-level directory contains a `latest` symbolic link, which MUST point to the latest buildpack version directory.

Additionally, there MUST be an [`order.toml`](#order.toml-(toml)) file at the root containing a list of buildpacks groups to use during the detection phase.

## Security Considerations

The platform SHOULD run each phase of the lifecycle in an isolated container to prevent untrusted app and buildpack code from accessing storage credentials needed during the export and analysis phases.
A more thorough explanation is provided in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

## Additional Guidance

### Environment

User-provided environment variables intended for build and launch SHOULD NOT come from the same list.
The end-user SHOULD be encouraged to define them separately.
The platform MAY determine the initial environment of the build phase, detection phase, and launch.
The lifecycle MUST NOT assume that all platforms provide an identical environment.

### Run Image Rebasing

Run image rebasing allows for fast stack updates for already-exported OCI images with minimal data transfer when those images are stored on a Docker registry.
When a new stack version is available, the app layers and launch layers SHOULD be rebased on the new run image by updating the image's configuration to point at the new run image.
Once the new run image is present on the registry, no filesystem layers should be uploaded or downloaded.

The new run image MUST have an identical stack ID and MUST include the exact same set of mixins.

### Caching

Each platform SHOULD implement caching so as to appropriately optimize performance. Cache locality and availability MAY vary between platforms.

## Data Format

### order.toml (TOML)

```toml
[[groups]]
labels = ["<label name>"]
buildpacks = [
  { id = "<buildpack ID>", version = "<buildpack version>", optional = <bool> }
]
```

Where:

- The buildpack ID MUST be present for each buildpack object in a group.
- The buildpack version MUST default to "latest" if not provided.
- Each buildpack MUST default to not optional if not specified in the object.
- Group labels MAY be present to enable the platform to consider a subset of groups for detection.

Example:

```toml
[[groups]]
labels = ["custom-dotnet"]
buildpacks = [
  { id = "io.buildpacks.nodejs", version = “latest”, optional = true },
  { id = "io.buildpacks.dotnet-core", version = “latest” }
]

[[groups]]
labels = ["custom-ruby", "ruby"]
buildpacks = [
  { id = "io.buildpacks.nodejs", version = “latest”, optional = true },
  { id = "io.buildpacks.ruby", version = “latest” }
]

[[groups]]
labels = ["ruby-datascience", "ruby"]
buildpacks = [
  { id = "io.buildpacks.python", version = “latest” },
  { id = "io.buildpacks.ruby", version = “latest” }
]
```

### group.toml (TOML)

```toml
buildpacks = [
  { id = "<buildpack ID>", version = "<buildpack version>" }
]
```

Where:

- The buildpack ID MUST be present for each buildpack object in a group.
- The buildpack version MUST default to "latest" if not provided.
